          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The MEH Project Board asked us to evaluate the pros and cons of a temporary pause in new development work so that we can address some of the problems facing the product within its current architecture. Some of the primary issues are listed below, and you can click each one for more detail: </p>

            <span class="detail-txt">Having the information that is needed in one place, such as imaging, is <strong>not currently possible</strong></span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Difficult to deploy and to support
            <span class="detail-txt"><strong>Costly to configure, deploy and support</strong> in different clinical environments due to lack of configurability</span></li>

              <span class="detail-txt">User journeys are not representative of behaviour as <strong>role based, patient centric workflows are not supported</strong></span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>We recommended a seven week Technical Proof of Concept (PoC) to prove or disprove five technical concepts which we believe could be key to the future of OpenEyes, and formulate platform migration options.</p>

          <h2>Architecture</h2>
          <p>The PoC architecture, which we believe is needed in order to address some of the problems faced by the OpenEyes development team, is made up of the following components:</p>
          <ul class="architecture-details">
            <li>Application Frontend: built in AngularJS, which is a JavaScript framework maintained by Google. It has a very active user base for contributions and is set up to aid separation of concerns, so enables modularity.</li>
            <li>JVM Based Service Layer: XXX</li>
            <li>Document data store: YYY</li>

          <h2>Workflow</h2>
          <p>We have demonstrated this architecture through a patient journey that is not well represented in OpenEyes today: a patient with Age Related Macular Degeneration.</p>

          <p>This patient accounts for 60% of patients at the Medical Retina Injection suite. Over the course of their care during a visit, the patient meets several different clinicians at the following steps:</p>

          <ul class="workflow-details">
            <li>Registration</li>
            <li>Vision Assessment</li>
