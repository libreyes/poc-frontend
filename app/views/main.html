          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The Moorfields Eye Hospital Project Board asked the OpenEyes team to evaluate the impact of a temporary pause in new development work. The purpose of this scheduled break is to address some of the challenges facing the product within its current architecture.</p>
          <p>The primary issues are listed below, please click on each issue for more detail: </p>
          <ul class="intro-details">

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)' ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Slow development speed
            <span class="detail-txt">The development team cannot scale up as <strong>modules are interdependent</strong></span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Inefficient development
            <span class="detail-txt"><strong>Change in clinical workflows has widespread implications</strong>, making development inefficient</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Reduced configurability
            <span class="detail-txt">The solution is not easily configured to meet customers’ requirements, including Moorfields’ satellites</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Lack of integration with other systems
            <span class="detail-txt">Having the information that is needed in one place, such as imaging, is <strong>not currently possible</strong></span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Difficult to deploy and to support
            <span class="detail-txt"><strong>Costly to configure, deploy and support</strong> in different clinical environments due to lack of configurability</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>User experience is hindered by the architecture
              <span class="detail-txt">User journeys are not representative of behaviour as <strong>role based, patient centric workflows are not supported</strong></span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The OpenEyes team recommended a 7 week Proof of Concept exercise to highlight a range of technical concepts that will provide the architectural solution OpenEyes needs to overcome these challenges.</p>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Application Frontend
            <span class="detail-txt">Built in Angular, which is a JavaScript framework maintained by Google. It has a very active user base for contributions and is set up to facilitate separation of concerns, so enables modularity. Allows multiple clients on multiple devices (tablet, PC, mobile)</span></li>

            <span class="detail-txt">A service orientated architecture allows developers to work in parallel, makes it easier to accommodate change and integrate with other systems and devices.</span></li>

            <span class="detail-txt">Enabled by a service layer architecture, with different teams working on different areas in parallel.</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Development speed
            <span class="detail-txt">Increased by de-coupling modules of functionality and developing in Java-based language such as Scala; furthermore by using Angular as a front-end.</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Workflow, Clinical scalability, Configurability and Deployment in multiple organisations
            <span class="detail-txt">Workflow defined by user role, location and speciality. Supports MEH transformation programme, allowing clinic workflows to be configured using our Workflow API to reflect practises of/within different organisations.</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Modularity
            <span class="detail-txt">Workflows are built comprising of modular elements which can easily be added, ordered and removed.</span></li>

            <li oe-clickable-list ng-click='toggleClose($event)'><span class="glyphicon"></span>Integration
            <span class="detail-txt">Technology choices give access to integration libraries which enable the proof of concept to easily connect to other systems and devices.</span></li>

          <h2>Workflow</h2>
          <p>The benefits of this architecture are showcased through an example patient journey that is not well defined in OpenEyes today: a patient with Age Related Macular Degeneration.</p>

          <p>This journey is representative of 60% of patients at the Medical Retina Injection Clinic. Over the course of their care during a visit, the patient meets several different clinicians in the following steps:</p>

          <ul class="workflow-details">
            <li>Registration</li>
            <li>Vision Assessment</li>
            <li>OCT Scan</li>
            <li>Assessment for AMD</li>
            <li>Injection</li>
          </ul>

          <p><em>Please note:</em></p>
          <p><em>This patient journey is solely intended to showcase the platform for the re-architecture and is not ready to be launched for use by Clinicians. It is NOT intended to show a redesign or rebrand, this will be one of the top priorities for the next phase of the project.</em></p>
